# Poker Calculator

 Calculate probabilities of winning at any stage of a poker hand against any number of other players.

 The functionality works by running a monte carlo simulation and averaging the results to calculate the probability. It is not yet optimised and can take some time to run.

There are two key classes here: the Card class that creates each playing card and the Deck class that stores the order of the deck of cards, the various hands and the state of the game.  

*This still needs to be refactored*
